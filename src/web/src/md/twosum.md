# Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Example:

Given `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`,

The answer is `[0, 1]`, because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`.

## Constraints:

- $2 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^4$
- $-10^9 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^9$
- $-10^9 \leq \text{target} \leq 10^9$
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Open Questions:

- Can you do it in linear time and constant space?
- What if the array is sorted?
- How about three numbers?
